## Good day!

Im Zisowa (he/him if you wish). 
A Python developer, also have experience in Lua coding, creating models in Blender, creating mods for some f2p game. I prefer to work alone, otherwise need a good team.
Actively using books and a few internet sources to learn clean code

Currently working on my simple Python game - Computer Scientist Simulator. Using this game to learn how to code everything properly.
I have a few simple Python projects - a space invaders styled game and a library program
